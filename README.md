## Install nvim latest version

### Install latest release AppImage

The Releases page provides an AppImage that runs on most Linux systems. No installation is needed, just download nvim.appimage and run it. (It might not work if your Linux distribution is more than 4 years old.)

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest/download/nvim.appimage
chmod u+x nvim.appimage
./nvim.appimage
```

If the ./nvim.appimage command fails, try:

```bash
./nvim.appimage --appimage-extract
./squashfs-root/AppRun --version

# Optional: exposing nvim globally.
sudo mv squashfs-root /
sudo ln -s /squashfs-root/AppRun /usr/bin/nvim
nvim
```

### Install from source

If a package is not provided for your platform, you can build Neovim from source. See Building-Neovim for details. If you have the prerequisites then building is easy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim
cd neovim
make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
sudo make install
```

For Unix-like systems this installs Neovim to /usr/local, while for Windows to C:\Program Files. Note, however, that this can complicate uninstallation. The following example avoids this by isolating an installation under $HOME/neovim:

```bash
rm -r build/  # clear the CMake cache
make CMAKE_EXTRA_FLAGS="-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/neovim"
make install
export PATH="$HOME/neovim/bin:$PATH"
```

### Uninstall

There is a CMake target to uninstall after make install:

```bash
sudo cmake --build build/ --target uninstall
```

Alternatively, just delete the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX artifacts:

```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/nvim
sudo rm -r /usr/local/share/nvim/
```

## Install my configuration files

Make sure to remove or move your current `nvim` directory located inside ~/,config

**IMPORTANT** Requires [Neovim v0.8.0]](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases).  [Upgrade](#upgrade-to-latest-release) if you're on an earlier version. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Atlas34/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Run `nvim` and wait for the plugins to be installed 

**NOTE** (You will notice treesitter pulling in a bunch of parsers the next time you open Neovim) 

## Install fonts

```bash
cp -rf ~/.config/nvim/fonts ~/.local/share/
```

## Get healthy

Open `nvim` and enter the following:

```
:checkhealth
```
